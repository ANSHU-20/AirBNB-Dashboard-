# AirBNB-Dashboard- Analysis in Power Bi

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard built to analyze Airbnb listings data. The project leverages data from **Inside Airbnb** to explore key trends, pricing strategies, and host activity within a specific market.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analytical tool for stakeholders (such as new hosts, market analysts, or data analysts) to understand the Airbnb landscape.

## üéØ Problem Statement & Key Questions

This dashboard was designed to answer several core business questions based on the provided project brief. The primary objectives are:

> 1. Which are the popular neighbourhoods, their average prices and no. of listings?
> 2. What is the percent share of different property types and room types?
> 3. How the pricing is varying with location, property type, and reviews?
> 4. What are the different correlations between type of hosts and factors like- reviews & price?
